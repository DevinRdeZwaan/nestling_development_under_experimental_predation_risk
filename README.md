### Project goals:
Nestling development is a critical life-history stage for altricial songbirds but is also highly vulnerable to predation. Rapid growth of mobility traits is a hypothesized response to predation risk with potential survival benefits. We experimentally elevated predation risk during the nestling stage for an alpine population of Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris) to assess the influence of predator cues and parental care on nestling wing growth and the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone. We used piecewise path analysis to test a hypothesized causal response structure composed of direct and indirect pathways.
